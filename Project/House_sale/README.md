# House Sales Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing house sales data from a city or town in the USA. The aim is to uncover insights and trends to assist in better understanding factors influencing house prices. Key Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn were used to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-learn for cleaning and transforming data.
- Comprehensive visualizations to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
- Regression models to analyze relationships between features and house prices.
- Interactive and insightful charts for better decision-making.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <URl>
   cd <House-sale>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Pipeline:** Data cleaning and transformation using Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` module.
- **Techniques Used:** Handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Trends in house prices over time.
  - Correlations between various features like size, location, and price.
  - Distribution of house prices and other numerical features.

### 3. Visualizations
- **Line Plots:** Analyzing price trends over time.
- **Scatter Plots with Regression:** Examining feature-price relationships using Seaborn's `regplot`.
- **Heatmap:** Correlation matrix using Seaborn's `heatmap` for numerical attributes.
- **Bar Plots:** Categorical feature analysis.

### 4. Machine Learning
- **Linear Regression:** Used Scikit-learn's `linear_model` to build a regression model predicting house prices.
- **Feature Importance:** Determined key features influencing house prices.

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file to execute the analysis:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Visualizations and insights will be generated and saved in the `output` directory.
